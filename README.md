A flexible loan amortisation schedule generator.

## The Problem	

My bank was charging me too much interest on my loans.
So I wrote this loan amortisation schedule generator to prove the bank wrong, as none of the online loan calculators or amortisation schedules could do exactly what I needed.

Turned out this proved that the bank was correct.
